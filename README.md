# Trigonometric Functions

This folder contains the matlab source code on how to plot the basic trigonomertic functions in MATLAB or GNU Octave in the interval of $$0 - 2{\pi}$$. with an increment of $$\frac{\pi}{100}$$ .
A figure window will appear with 6 plots arranged in a 3x2 grid :
1. Plot 1: sin(x)
2. Plot 2: cos(x)
3. Plot 3: tan(x)
4. Plot 4: csc(x)
5. Plot 5: sec(x)
6. Plot 6: cot(x)
