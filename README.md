# GnuOctave-MATLAB
This repository contains a collection of example scripts written in GNU Octave and MATLAB, showcasing a variety of concepts.

# Gnu Octave Tutorial 
This folder contains essential information required to work with GNU Octave, along with a basic tutorial on how to use the software effectively.
In general, most Octave code is compatible with MATLAB; however, there are some discrepancies that may arise when transitioning between the two platforms. 

# Trigonometric Functions
This folder contains the GNU Octave/MATLAB source code on how to plot the basic trigonomertic functions in MATLAB or GNU Octave in the interval of $$0 - 2{\pi}$$. with an increment of $$\frac{\pi}{100}$$ .
A figure window will appear with 6 plots arranged in a 3x2 grid :
1. Plot 1: sin(x)
2. Plot 2: cos(x)
3. Plot 3: tan(x)
4. Plot 4: csc(x)
5. Plot 5: sec(x)
6. Plot 6: cot(x)

# Signals
This folder contains GNU Octave/MATLAB source code for plotting basic signals in both discrete-time and continuous-time domains.
The following signals are studied :
1. Unit Step Function
2. Unit Impulse Function
3. Ramp Function
4. Exponential Function
5. Complex Exponential Function
6. Sinusoidal Functions 


# Miscellaneous
This folder contains some fun projects that are really capable to tinker with your creative thinking abilities!
